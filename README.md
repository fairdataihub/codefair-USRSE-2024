# Repository of the Codefair material for the US-RSE 2024 conference (October 15-17, 2024)

## About

This repository contains the material and information associated with our poster presentation and talk at the 2nd Annual Conference of the US Research Software Engineer Associate (US-RSE 2024). We are presenting Codefair, an open source and free GitHub app for research software FAIR.

Making research software Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR), i.e. optimally reusable by humans and machines, is crucial to ensure the reproducibility of research outcomes, prevent duplicate effort, and utimately increase the pace of discoveries and innovations. However, making software FAIR can be time consuming and difficult to implement. To address that, we are developing Codefair, a GitHub app that allows you to make research software FAIR without breaking a sweat! You can find out more about Codefair at [codefair.io](https://codefair.io/).
